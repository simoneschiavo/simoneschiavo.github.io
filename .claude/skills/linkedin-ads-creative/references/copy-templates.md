# Copy Templates by Funnel Stage

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with business problem**, not product
2. **Specific beats clever** — numbers + timeframe + context
3. **One ad = one promise + one action**
4. **Match message to intent** — cold teaches, warm proves, hot converts

## TOFU (Awareness): "Make Them Care"

**Objective:** Attention, relevance, engagement, cheap clicks to useful content.
**Audience:** Cold — they don't know you yet.

### Copy Strategy

Are you *still* [doing problematic thing] without knowing [critical insight]?

Here's a simple [framework/guide] to [achieve outcome].
```
Headline: "[Framework/Guide Name]"
CTA: "Download"

**Contrarian Hook:**
```
The next [competitive advantage] won't be [obvious thing].

It'll be [surprising insight] + [supporting element].

Here's what to do in [year].
```
Headline: "[Playbook/Guide Name]"
CTA: "Learn more"
