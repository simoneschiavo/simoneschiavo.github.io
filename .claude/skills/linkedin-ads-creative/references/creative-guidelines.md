# Creative Guidelines for LinkedIn Ads

## Core Rule

**Copy and creative must say the same thing.**

The visual should carry the main idea even if they don't read. The creative does 60% of the work.

---

## Design Rules That Consistently Perform

1. **One message per creative** — Never split attention
2. **Big headline** — 5-7 words max on the image
3. **High contrast** — Clean layout, readable at small sizes
4. **Simple visuals** — Icons, simple charts, clear imagery
5. **Brand mark** — Subtle but consistent placement

## What to Put in the Image

Choose ONE approach per creative:

### A Single Promise
- "Improve AI Visibility"
- "Find High-Intent Regions"
- "Automate GEO Actions"
- "Scale Without Wasting Budget"

### A Metric
- "CAC -28%"
- "Qualified demos +18%"
- "3x Pipeline in 60 Days"
- "Cut Waste by 40%"

### A Testimonial Snippet
- "We finally know which markets convert."
- "Best investment we made this quarter."
- Short quote with attribution

## Visual Elements by Funnel Stage

### TOFU (Awareness)
**Goal:** Scroll-stopping, curiosity-inducing

- Bold, contrarian statements
- Eye-catching data points
- Questions that make them pause
- Framework previews (3-5 steps visible)

**Avoid:** Product UI, detailed features, company logos

### MOFU (Consideration)
**Goal:** Build trust, show proof

- Case study results (before/after)
- Customer logos (if permitted)
- Testimonial cards with photo
- Demo snippet or workflow preview
- Comparison visuals

**Avoid:** Generic stock photos, abstract concepts

### BOFU (Conversion)
**Goal:** Clear offer, remove friction

- Simple offer statement
- Risk reversal messaging prominent
- Clean CTA-focused design
- Founder/team photo (optional, adds trust)

**Avoid:** Busy designs, multiple messages

---

## Mobile-First Requirements

Assume 70%+ mobile consumption.

### Do:
- Large, readable text (minimum 24pt equivalent)
- High contrast (test in bright light)
- Simple compositions
- Zoom into one meaningful area if showing UI

### Don't:
- Small text
- Busy dashboards
- Tiny UI screenshots
- Multiple text blocks
- Fine details that disappear on mobile

---

## Color and Contrast

- **Primary message:** Highest contrast (dark on light or light on dark)
- **Supporting elements:** Lower contrast, don't compete
- **Brand colors:** Use consistently but don't let them reduce readability
- **Test:** Squint at thumbnail size — can you still read it?

---

## Text Overlay Guidelines

### Headline (Required)
- 5-7 words max
- Single clear message
- Largest text on the creative

### Supporting Text (Optional)
- Only if it clarifies without cluttering
- Smaller than headline
- Max 10-15 words

### Avoid
- Paragraphs on images
- Repeating the primary text copy
- Multiple competing messages

---

## Image Dimensions and Specs

### Single Image
- **Recommended:** 1200 x 1200px (1:1) or 1200 x 627px (1.91:1)
- 1:1 works better on mobile
- 1.91:1 for more horizontal content

### Carousel
- **Each card:** 1080 x 1080px (1:1)
- 3-5 cards ideal
- First card must hook, last card must CTA

### Video
- **Recommended:** 1:1 or 4:5 for mobile
- First 3 seconds must hook
- Captions required (80% watch muted)

---

## Carousel-Specific Guidelines

Structure for maximum engagement:

1. **Card 1:** Hook — Problem or provocative question
2. **Cards 2-4:** Insight — Teaching or proof
3. **Final Card:** CTA — Clear next step

Each card should:
- Make sense standalone
- Flow logically when swiped
- Have consistent visual style
- Not require reading previous cards to understand
