# Audience Targeting Guide

## Cold Audience Targeting

### Standard Targeting Stack

Combine these attributes:
- **Location** (countries/regions)
- **Company size** (11–50, 51–200, 201–500, 501–5000, 5001+)
- **Industry**
- **Job Function** + **Seniority**
- Optional: **Skills**, **Groups** (can be noisy)

### When to Use What

**Need scale:**
- Function + Seniority + Industry + Size
- Broader, more impressions, better for TOFU

**Need precision:**
- Job Titles + Company attributes
- Risk: audience too small, higher CPMs
- Better for BOFU/ABM

## ABM Audiences (Matched Audiences)

### Account Lists (Company Targeting)

1. Upload target companies (names or domains)
2. Layer with: Function + Seniority to hit decision-makers
3. Keep lists clean and refresh monthly/quarterly

### Contact Lists (People Targeting)

1. Upload known leads/prospects (email required)
2. Use for: pipeline acceleration, reactivation, BOFU
3. Match rate varies; larger lists perform better

### ABM Watchouts

- Match rate is imperfect (expect 30-70%)
- Always exclude customers if running acquisition
- Refresh lists regularly
- Layer with job function for precision

## Retargeting Audiences

Create separate audiences by intent level:

### Must-Have Segments

| Audience | Lookback | Intent Level | Use For |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| All site visitors | 90 days | Low-Medium | MOFU nurture |
| High-intent pages | 30 days | High | BOFU conversion |
| Content viewers | 90 days | Low | MOFU content |

### High-Intent Pages (Examples)

- /pricing
- /demo
- /product
- /contact
- /trial

### Engagement Retargeting

- Video viewers (25%/50%/75%)
- Ad engagers (clicks, likes, comments)
- Company page visitors
- Lead form openers (if using forms)

---

## Required Exclusions

Apply to ALL campaigns to save budget:

### Always Exclude

1. **Employees** (your company)
2. **Existing customers** (account list)
3. **Recent converters** (thank-you page visitors, 30-90 days)

### Optional Exclusions

- Competitors (if you have a list)
- Unqualified industries
- Regions you don't serve

## Audience Sizing Guidelines

| Audience Size | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| < 10,000 | Too small for cold. OK for retargeting. |
| 10,000 - 50,000 | Good for precise targeting. Watch frequency. |
| 50,000 - 300,000 | Ideal for most campaigns. |
| > 300,000 | Good for scale. May need tighter targeting. |
