## Budget Tiers and Recommendations

### Low Budget (< €3,000/month)

**Constraints:**
- Not enough spend for 10 campaigns
- Need to focus ruthlessly

**Recommendation:**
- 1 cold campaign + 1 retargeting campaign
- Pick ONE persona
- Broader targeting (function + seniority)
- Optimize for traffic or ONE conversion only
- Single image + Carousel (cheaper to produce)

**Warning:** Below €1,500/month, LinkedIn learning phase struggles. Consider reallocating to other channels.

## Optimization Cadence

### Weekly Check

1. **Spend pacing** — Are campaigns spending?
2. **CTR** — Creative relevance (benchmark: 0.4-0.6%+)
3. **Landing page view rate** — Click quality
4. **Conversion rate** — Landing page + offer working?
5. **CPA/CPL** — Within target?
6. **Downstream quality** — MQL→SQL→Opp in CRM

### Diagnostic Rules

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Low spend + low impressions | Bid too low OR audience too narrow | Increase bid or broaden audience |
| High spend + low CTR | Creative mismatch OR wrong audience | Test new creative or refine targeting |
| Good CTR + poor conversions | Landing page or offer problem | Optimize landing page, test offers |
| Great conversions but low quality | Targeting too broad | Tighten targeting, add qualifying step |

## Frequency and Fatigue

### Warning Signs

- Frequency climbing above 3-4
- CTR declining
- Conversion rate dropping

### Fixes

1. Refresh creative
2. Expand audience
3. Reduce budget on that campaign
4. Add new campaigns with fresh angles

**Rule:** Avoid hammering tiny audiences with huge budgets.
