# Brainstorm: What Matters When Execution Becomes Cheap

*Date: 2026-02-09*

## Core Thesis

When AI makes execution cheap/free, what becomes valuable? The article explores the widening gap between early adopters who develop taste/judgment and everyone else (digital divide 2.0).

**Article intent:** Honest exploration. No claimed solutions. Name the problem clearly enough that readers can make an informed choice.

## Key Themes

### 1. Interface Flux is a Distraction
- Chat → CLI → Chat again (Claude app → Claude Code → Codex)
- This is just a UX layer
- The real question: what stays constant underneath?

### 2. Portable Skills vs. Portable Thinking
- Skill files aren't portable (CLAUDE.md won't work in Codex, custom instructions don't port)
- What's actually portable: **the thinking that produced the skill**
- "I know what a good activation flow looks like, and I can teach any AI to help me build one"
- The pattern recognition, not the prompt

### 3. The Ebook Parallel
- Downloading a skill = the ebook lead gen of 10-15 years ago
- You can download someone's skill, but without the reps, you don't know when it's failing you
- skills.sh and similar initiatives are useful but insufficient
- You need to do the work yourself, build your own battle-tested library

### 4. The Comprehension Debt Paradox
From Dylan Martin's "Spinning the Wheel" (https://dylanamartin.com/2026/02/02/spinning-the-wheel.html):
- AI-assisted work = dopamine loop ("low effort, variable reward, endlessly repeatable")
- Speed and fun are "the bribe" for surrendering expertise
- Comprehension debt accumulates when AI one-shots implementations without learning

**The tension:** Comprehension debt vs. building durable expertise. How to balance?

### 5. Convergence to Average
- AI models are averaging machines
- Better context = better results, but...
- If everyone uses AI, does everyone converge to the mean?
- How do you stand out when the baseline rises?

### 6. Taste as the Moat
References:
- Mind the Product: "Taste: The Key to Creating Exceptional Digital Products" (https://www.mindtheproduct.com/taste-the-key-to-creating-exceptional-digital-products/)
- The Atlantic: "Good Taste AI" (June 2025)

Key insight: "Creative judgment is the ultimate competitive advantage...that instinct becomes your moat."

**But:** Taste is developed through reps, through failure, through doing the work badly then well. If AI handles execution, where do the reps come from?

### 7. Competition Moves Upstream
AI makes execution cheap → execution is no longer a differentiator. The moat becomes upstream decisions:
- What do you notice that others don't?
- What do you refuse to ship that others would accept?
- What problems do you pick that AI can't average its way toward?

**Possible reframe:** Reps move from "how to write an onboarding flow" to "evaluating whether this onboarding flow actually works." Craft shifts from creation to curation + judgment.

**Counter-argument:** This might be a convenient rationalization for the dopamine loop.

### 8. The Feedback Loop Trap (Core Problem)

This is the dark heart of the piece:

```
Tools get better
    → you delegate more
    → fewer reps
    → weaker judgment
    → you can't tell when output is mediocre
    → you accept it
    → you fall further behind people who can tell
    → (repeat)
```

**The cruel part:** It feels productive the whole time. You're shipping. You're moving fast. The slot machine keeps paying out. You don't notice the drift until you're competing against someone with actual taste and you can't figure out why their work lands and yours doesn't.

**Why this is a big problem:**
- You cannot shortcut taste acquisition
- As tools get better, the inclination is to rely more and more on tools for everything
- The loop accelerates in the wrong direction

## The Digital Divide Angle

The gap isn't "can you use AI" — everyone will be able to. The gap is:
- Early adopters develop taste through experimentation
- They learn what to ask for and how to evaluate output
- They build scar tissue from doing the work
- Everyone else downloads skills and stays at average

This creates a new digital divide: not access to tools, but capacity to use them meaningfully.

## Article Approach

**What this article is NOT:**
- ~~Warning shot~~ — awareness alone doesn't solve it
- ~~Practical guide~~ — "here's how to build taste while using tools" — don't have that answer, won't pretend to

**What this article IS:**
- **Honest exploration** — "I don't know how to solve this. Here's the tension I'm sitting in."
- More vulnerable, but more useful because it's true
- Names the choice clearly: **cheap execution now vs. durable judgment later**
- Most people will pick cheap execution. That's the divide.

## Possible Structure

1. Open with interface flux (but quickly dismiss as surface-level)
2. The instability problem (OpenAI burning $100M+/month, tools changing constantly)
3. What's actually portable? Not skills, but thinking
4. The ebook parallel — downloading skills ≠ having them
5. The convergence-to-average problem
6. Taste as the answer — but taste requires reps
7. The feedback loop trap — why this gets worse, not better
8. **Name the choice explicitly:** cheap execution now vs. durable judgment later
9. The new digital divide: not access, but judgment
10. Close without resolution — sit in the tension honestly

## Unresolved Questions (Intentionally Left Open)

These stay unresolved. The article doesn't pretend to have answers.

- Should we even care about comprehension debt? Maybe the world just changes.
- Is "judgment over execution" a real skill shift or just cope?
- Can you develop taste by evaluating AI output, or do you need to have done it yourself first?
- What's the minimum viable reps to develop judgment in a domain?
- Is there a way out of the feedback loop, or is it just a choice you make with eyes open?
