## Introduction/Overview

This project involves redesigning a personal portfolio website to replicate the style and structure of Brittany Chiang's portfolio (brittanychiang.com). The website will serve as a professional showcase for a Senior Growth Marketer in the B2B SaaS space, focusing on job hunting and personal branding. The site will feature a modern, accessible design with sections for About, Experience, Projects, and Writing.

## Goals

2. Implement a modern, accessible design that replicates Brittany Chiang's visual style and structure
3. Establish a strong personal brand presence for job hunting in the B2B SaaS industry
4. Build a maintainable platform for ongoing content updates and future enhancements
5. Complete the project by end of week to meet the user's timeline

## User Stories

1. **As a hiring manager**, I want to quickly understand the candidate's professional background and expertise so that I can assess their fit for growth marketing roles.

2. **As a recruiter**, I want to see a clean, professional presentation of the candidate's experience and projects so that I can effectively represent them to clients.

3. **As a potential collaborator**, I want to learn about the candidate's skills and past work so that I can determine if they'd be a good fit for partnership opportunities.

4. **As the website owner**, I want to easily update my content and maintain my professional presence so that I can keep my portfolio current as my career progresses.

5. **As a visitor using assistive technology**, I want the website to be fully accessible so that I can navigate and consume all content regardless of my abilities.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Header/Navigation**: The website must include a fixed header with smooth scroll navigation to main sections (About, Experience, Projects, Writing).

2. **Hero Section**: The website must display a prominent hero section with the user's name, professional title ("Growth Marketer"), and a brief tagline about their expertise.

3. **About Section**: The website must include an About section with placeholder biographical content, professional focus, and current role information.

4. **Experience Section**: The website must display a chronological list of professional experiences with placeholder content including:

   - Company names and roles
   - Date ranges
   - Brief descriptions of responsibilities
   - Relevant technologies/skills used

5. **Projects Section**: The website must showcase exactly 2 projects with placeholder content including:

   - Project titles and descriptions
   - Technologies used
   - Links to live demos or repositories (placeholder links)
   - Project images or screenshots (placeholder images)

6. **Writing Section**: The website must include a Writing/Blog section with placeholder blog post entries including:

   - Article titles
   - Publication dates
   - Brief descriptions
   - Placeholder links

7. **Social Links**: The website must include prominent links to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

8. **Responsive Design**: The website must be fully responsive and work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

9. **Dark Theme**: The website must implement a dark color scheme consistent with the reference design.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Content Management System**: No CMS integration required for initial version
2. **Blog Functionality**: No dynamic blog posting system - static content only
3. **Contact Forms**: No interactive contact forms - simple email links sufficient
4. **Analytics Integration**: No analytics tracking for initial version
5. **SEO Optimization**: Basic SEO practices only, no advanced optimization
6. **Multi-language Support**: English only for initial version
7. **User Authentication**: No login or user account functionality
8. **E-commerce Features**: No payment processing or product sales
9. **Custom Brand Elements**: No custom colors, fonts, or visual elements beyond the reference design

## Design Considerations

1. **Visual Style**: Replicate the exact visual style of brittanychiang.com including:

   - Dark blue/navy color scheme
   - Typography hierarchy and font choices
   - Layout structure and spacing
   - Button and link styles

2. **Component Structure**: Build reusable React components for:

   - Navigation header
   - Section layouts
   - Project cards
   - Experience timeline items
   - Writing/blog post cards

3. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance including:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Alt text for images
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Screen reader compatibility

## Technical Considerations

1. **Technology Stack**:

   - React for component-based architecture
   - Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
   - Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
   - Build tool (Vite or Create React App) to compile React for static deployment
   - GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment to GitHub Pages

2. **GitHub Pages Constraints**:

   - Static site hosting only - no server-side functionality
   - Must build to static HTML/CSS/JS files
   - Requires build process to compile React components
   - Need to configure proper routing for single-page application
   - Base URL configuration may be required depending on repository setup

3. **Performance**:

   - Optimize images and assets for fast loading
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Minimize bundle size for faster GitHub Pages serving

4. **Deployment Strategy**:

   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
   - Configure build output to `docs/` folder or `gh-pages` branch
   - Ensure proper asset paths for GitHub Pages subdirectory structure

5. **Code Quality**: Follow React best practices and maintain clean, readable code structure

## Success Metrics

1. **Completion**: Successfully deploy a fully functional website by end of week
2. **Visual Fidelity**: Achieve close visual replication of the reference design
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensure proper display across all device sizes
4. **Accessibility**: Pass basic accessibility audits
5. **Performance**: Achieve good Lighthouse scores for performance and best practices

## Open Questions

1. **Repository Setup**: Will this be deployed from a personal GitHub repository (username.github.io) or a project repository (username.github.io/project-name)?
2. **Build Tool Preference**: Should we use Vite (faster, modern) or Create React App (more established) for the build process?
3. **Content Strategy**: What specific placeholder content should be used for the growth marketing focus?
4. **Future Enhancements**: What additional features might be added after the initial launch?
5. **Brand Evolution**: How will custom branding elements be incorporated in future iterations?
6. **Content Updates**: What process will be used for updating content after launch?
